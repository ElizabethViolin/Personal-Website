    "description": "Fun fact: I speak fluent Mandarin. At Jreamscape, the majority of the employees come from China. So not only has this company given me valuable full stack work experience, but also my Mandarin has become much more natural and conversational. The specifics about what I've accomplished during this internship are listed on every other platform and document that my name appears, so I'll let you read that elsewhere!",
